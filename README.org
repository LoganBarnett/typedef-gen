This is a place where I've put utilities for generating code for [[https://flow.org][Flow]] library
definitions when the definitions are quite large and error prone for a human to
do, but are simple enough to generate programmatically. This includes functions
such as [[http://ramdajs.com][Ramda's]] [[http://ramdajs.com/docs/#partial][partial]].

This is all written up in [[index.org]], and the results of that file can be tangled
using [[http://www.literateprogramming.com][literate programming]] to produce utilities for others to use who can't take
advantage of [[http://orgmode.org][org-mode]].

To generate Ramda's partial type defintion, simply invoke the following from
your shell:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
node ramda-partial.js
#+END_SRC
